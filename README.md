# Telangana-Project
Telangana is one of India’s leading states and has published its tourism data under its open data policy.

As a data analyst, Peter Pandey saw this as an opportunity to expand his skills and show his work on a bigger scale. Peter Pandey’s idea is to find the patterns in the given data, do additional research, and give data-informed recommendations to the Telangana government which can be used to increase their revenue by improving administrative operations.
 
Peter began his work by framing some primary, and secondary research questions and recommendation ideas.
